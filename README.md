# SobekCM-plugin-viewer-WebRTIViewer
<p>SobekCM-plugin-viewer-WebRTIViewer is a plugin for the open-source SobekCM Digital Repository software (Mark V. Sullivan, lead developer). It provides a viewer for high resolution Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) content using WebRTIViewer, a HTML5-WebGL viewer created by Gianpaolo Palma.</p>
<p>The multires.js file was modified to work within the plugin structure, including using the SobekCM item content folder URL.</p>
<h2>BETA</h2>
<p>This project is still in beta because it depends upon a SobekCM feature net yet available. The ability to upload a folder of files in the item Manage Files function will become available in an upcoming release.<br/><br/><quote>Testing the plugin:<ul><li>Complete the plugin installation steps.</li><li>Create a new item.</li><li>Create a sub-folder named "rti" in the root of your test item's content folder.</li><li>Copy all of the files in the (2nd sample RTI content provided) plugin-folder/sample2-chi-WLR-tbird folder into the new rti sub-folder.</li><li>If the rti content folder is not available the plugin will display the RTI content in the RTI plugin sample sub-folder by default.</li></ul></quote></p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarkVSullivan">Mark V. Sullivan</a> (SobekCM's lead developer) - After deploying the WebRTIViewer externally and testing it by embedding it in a SobekCM record I wanted to create a new SobekCM viewer plugin using it. Initial development of this plugin began in collaboration with Mark during an excellent training session he provided to me in December 2016.</p>

<p>webGLRTIMaker - this Windows console app was used to generate the derivative RTI content files from the sample ptm file. webGLRTIMaker is included with the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~palma/webRTIViewer.zip">webRTIViewer</a> software.</p>
<p>webRTIViewer - using their webrti sample RTI content as the default content if the rti sub-folder is not available in the SobekCM item content folder. The sample content used is in the webViewer/webrti folder in the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/~palma/webRTIViewer.zip">webRTIViewer.zip</a> which is linked on the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php">WebRTIViewer</a> page [Link (code, binary and examples)].</p>
