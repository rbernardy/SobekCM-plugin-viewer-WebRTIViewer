# SobekCM-plugin-viewer-WebRTIViewer
<p>SobekCM-plugin-viewer-WebRTIViewer is a plugin for the open-source SobekCM Digital Repository software (Mark V. Sullivan, lead developer). It provides a viewer for high resolution Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) content using WebRTIViewer, a HTML5-WebGL viewer created by Gianpaolo Palma.</p>
<h2>BETA</h2>
<p>This project is still in beta because it depends upon a SobekCM feature available in an upcoming release (Manage Files/upload a folder of files). For testing with the plugin - after completing the plugin installation steps create a new item. Create a sub-folder name "rti" in the root of your test item's content folder. Copy all of the files in the (2nd sample provided) plugin-folder/rti_haghpat_4656 folder into the rti folder. If the rti content folder is not available the plugin will display the RTI content in the RTI plugin sample sub-folder by default.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MarkVSullivan">Mark V. Sullivan</a> (SobekCM's lead developer) - After deploying the WebRTIViewer externally and testing it by embedding it in a SobekCM record I wanted to create a new SobekCM viewer plugin using it. Initial development of this plugin began in collaboration with Mark during an excellent training session he provided to me in December 2016.</p>
